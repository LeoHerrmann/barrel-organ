# Barrel-Organ

A web application which magically turns your phone into a barrel organ

## Intended use
- Open the application using a phone (e.g. by clicking [here](https://leoherrmann.github.io/Barrel-Organ/))
- Select an audio file, preferably with music
- Put the phone on a pivotable surface, for example an office chair
- Start rotating the pivotable surface. The audio file will be played as long as the device is rotating. Just like on a true barrel organ, the playback speed depends on the turning speed!
